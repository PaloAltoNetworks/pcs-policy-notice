  "description": "This policy identifies Security groups that are exposing ports to all traffic that are not covered in other policies. It is recommended that global permission be reduced as much as possible. Ports excluded from this policy are; 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 53, 80, 135, 137, 138, 139, 443, 445, 1433, 1434, 3306, 3389, 4333, 1194, 5672 and 5432 which are covered in other policies. As a best practice, restrict ports solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",
