  "name": "AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) is not using the latest predefined security policy",
  "description": "This policy identifies Application Load Balancers (ALBs) are not using the latest predefined security policy. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers. The protocol establishes a secure connection between a client and a server and ensures that all data passed between the client and your load balancer is private. A cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message. So it is recommended to use the latest predefined security policy which uses only secured protocol and ciphers.\n\nWe recommend using ELBSecurityPolicy-FS-1-2-Res-2020-10 policy if you require Forward Secrecy (FS) and use ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-Ext-2018-06 policy to meet compliance and security standards that require disabling certain TLS protocol versions or to support legacy clients that require deprecated ciphers.\n\nFor more details:\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html#describe-ssl-policies",
