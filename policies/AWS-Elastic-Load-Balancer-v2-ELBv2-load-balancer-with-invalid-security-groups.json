  "description": "This policy identifies Elastic Load Balancer v2 (ELBv2) load balancers that do not have security groups with a valid inbound or outbound rule. A security group with no inbound/outbound rule will deny all incoming/outgoing requests. ELBv2 security groups should have at least one inbound and outbound rule, ELBv2 with no inbound/outbound permissions will deny all traffic incoming/outgoing to/from any resources configured behind that ELBv2; in other words, the ELBv2 is useless without inbound and outbound permissions.",
