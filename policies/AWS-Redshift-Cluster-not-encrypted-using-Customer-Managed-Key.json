  "description": "This policy identifies Redshift Clusters which are encrypted with default KMS keys and not with Keys managed by Customer. It is a best practice to use customer managed KMS Keys to encrypt your Redshift databases data. Customer-managed CMKs give you more flexibility, including the ability to create, rotate, disable, define access control for, and audit the encryption keys used to help protect your data.",
