  "description": "This policy identifies GCP GCE Disk snapshots that are not encrypted with CSEK. It is recommended that to avoid data leakage provide your own encryption keys, Compute Engine uses your key to protect the Google-generated keys used to encrypt and decrypt your data. Only users who can provide the correct key can use resources protected by a customer-supplied encryption key.\n\n",

To resolve the alert a new instance can be created from the snapshot and disks can be encrypted as per the requirement. Then delete the alerted snapshot.\n\nTo create an Instance,\n1.
