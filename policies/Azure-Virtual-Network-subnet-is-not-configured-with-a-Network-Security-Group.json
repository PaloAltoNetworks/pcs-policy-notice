  "description": "This policy identifies Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnets that are not associated with a Network Security Group (NSG). While binding an NSG to a network interface of a Virtual Machine (VM) enables fine-grained control to the VM, associating a NSG to a subnet enables better control over network traffic to all resources within a subnet. As a best practice, associate an NSG with a subnet so that you can protect your VMs on a subnet-level.\n\nFor more information, see https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/igorpag/2016/05/14/azure-network-security-groups-nsg-best-practices-and-lessons-learned/\n\nNote: This policy will not report for subnets used by Azure Firewall, Gateway and NetApp File Share as Azure recommends not to configure Network Security Group (NSG) for these services.",
