  "description": "This policy identifies GCP Kubernetes Engine clusters that are not using Release Channel for version management. Subscribing to a specific release channel reduces version management complexity. \n\nThe Regular release channel upgrades every few weeks and is for production users who need features not yet offered in the Stable channel. These versions have passed internal validation, but don't have enough historical data to guarantee their stability. Known issues generally have known workarounds.\n\nThe Stable release channel upgrades every few months and is for production users who need stability above all else, and for whom frequent upgrades are too risky. These versions have passed internal validation and have been shown to be stable and reliable in production, based on the observed performance of those clusters.",
