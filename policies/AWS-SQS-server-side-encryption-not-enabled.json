  "description": "This policy identifies SQS queues that are not enabled with Server Side Encryption (SSE). SSE lets you transmit sensitive data in encrypted queues. SSE protects the contents of messages in Amazon SQS queues using keys managed in the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). SSE encrypts messages as soon as Amazon SQS receives them. The messages are stored in encrypted form and Amazon SQS decrypts messages only when they are sent to an authorized consumer.\n\nSQS SSE and the AWS KMS security standards can help you meet encryption-related compliance requirements.",
