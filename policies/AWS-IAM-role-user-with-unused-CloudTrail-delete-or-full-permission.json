  "name": "AWS IAM role/user with unused CloudTrail delete or full permission",
  "description": "This policy identifies IAM roles/users that have unused CloudTrail delete permission or CloudTrail full permissions. As a security best practice, it is recommended to grant the least privilege access like granting only the permissions required to perform a task, instead of providing excessive permissions to a particular role/user. It helps to reduce the potential improper or unintended access to your critical CloudTrail infrastructure.",
