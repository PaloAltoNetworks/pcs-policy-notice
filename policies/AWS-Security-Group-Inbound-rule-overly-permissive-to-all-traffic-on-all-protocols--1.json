  "name": "AWS Security Group Inbound rule overly permissive to all traffic on all protocols (-1)",
  "description": "This policy identifies Security groups that are overly permissive to all traffic on all protocols (-1). Doing so, may allow a bad actor to brute force their way into the system and potentially get access to the entire network. Review your list of security group rules to ensure that your resources are not exposed. As a best practice, restrict protocols solely to known static IP addresses. Limit the access list to include known hosts, services, or specific employees only.",

Select the 'Security Group' reported in the alert\n4. Click on the 'Inbound Rule'\n5. Remove the rule which has the 'Source' value as 0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0 and the 'Type' value as All traffic.",
