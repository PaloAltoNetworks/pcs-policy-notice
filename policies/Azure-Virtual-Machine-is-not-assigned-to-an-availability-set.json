  "name": "Azure Virtual Machine is not assigned to an availability set",
  "description": "This policy identifies Azure VMs that are not deployed in an availability set. To provide application redundancy during planned or unplanned maintenance events, you can group two or more virtual machines (VMs) in an availability set. An availability set ensures that the VMs are distributed across multiple isolated hardware nodes in a cluster so that only a subset of your VMs are impacted should a hardware or software failure occur on Azure. As a high availability (HA) best practice, deploy your VMs in an availability set.",

  "recommendation": "You must configure an availability set when you launch a VM. You need to launch a new instance of the VM to move it in or out of an availability set.\n\nFor more information about an availability set, visit https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability#configure-multiple-virtual-machines-in-an-availability-set-for-redundancy",
